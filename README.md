PixPuzzle
=========

A simple Pathpix-like puzzle app, made for fun.

## Description

PixPuzzle is a simple "connect the dots" game in a grid and with the addition of color.

It takes an image as a source and generate a puzzle from it. The player has to fill all the grid to complete the level and unlock a new image.

## Project state

This project is not under development anymore, as I am not using Xamarin for now.

Plus, I don't want to just make and sell a copy of an existing game. I tried to add some features like "take a picture -> generate a puzzle from it" but I wasn't convinced with the result.

Apart from that, the game is pretty functionnal (but not optimized at all and with some render issues).

## Technical side

This project is made with Xamarin and target iOS devices (mainly iPads).

## Windows Phone?

It used to work on iOS and Windows Phone, but the Windows Phone project hasn't been updated for a while. But still, with few modifications the game should be working again.
